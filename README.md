# ðŸ’« About Me:
Hello there (General Kenoby). Welcome to my Github page. My name is Marcos, and I'm a Computer Engineering student at Unoesc, second year. Here, you're gonna find a few small projects I made just to practice my skills while I learn new subjects in my academic careers. Currently, I'm working on a personal project along with one of my colleagues, so if anyone wants to come along and help us develop it, you're gonna be welcome to join us. Also, one of my goals is to help with the open source comunity.

How to reach out to me: marcos.land@unoesc.edu.br
